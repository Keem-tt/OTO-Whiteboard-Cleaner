# OTO â€“ Automated Whiteboard Cleaner

OTO is a low-cost, Arduino-powered whiteboard cleaner designed for classrooms, lecture halls, and meeting spaces. Built as my senior capstone project in Mechatronics Engineering, OTO offers modular expandability, affordability, and easy assembly.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Cleans standard whiteboards using rack-and-pinion motion
- Expandable to fit 4ft x 8ft boards and beyond
- Cost-effective: prototype costs ~$137 with ~$3.73 per 0.5ft expansion
- Arduino-powered with TMC2209 stepper motor control
- Safety-integrated with limit switches on both ends

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents
| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `CAD/` | All 3D-printed STL files used in the prototype |
| `Code/` | Arduino `.ino` file for motor control logic |
| `Report/` | Capstone report (PDF)|
| `Media/` | Turntable video|

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
This project challenged me across disciplinesâ€”from mechanical design and 3D printing to embedded programming and cost analysis. I iterated multiple times to resolve gear alignment, weight imbalance, and integration challenges.
