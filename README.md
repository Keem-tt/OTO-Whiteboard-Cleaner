# OTO â€“ Automated Whiteboard Cleaner

OTO is a low-cost, Arduino-powered whiteboard cleaner designed for classrooms, lecture halls, and meeting spaces. Built as my senior capstone project in Mechatronics Engineering, OTO offers modular expandability, affordability, and easy assembly.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Cleans standard whiteboards using rack-and-pinion motion
- Expandable to fit 4ft x 8ft boards and beyond
- Cost-effective: prototype costs ~$137 with ~$3.73 per 0.5ft expansion
- Arduino-powered with TMC2209 stepper motor control
- Safety-integrated with limit switches on both ends

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents
- `Final_Report.pdf` â€“ Full technical report with documentation and analysis
- `Code/` â€“ Arduino files for button-activated cleaning cycles
- `CAD/` â€“ 3D printable parts, Fusion 360 exports (STL, STEP)
- `Images/` â€“ Prototype, wiring, and exploded view images
- `BOM.xlsx` â€“ Detailed bill of materials and component costs
- `Wiring_Diagram.png` â€“ Electrical schematic (Tinkercad/Fritzing)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
This project challenged me across disciplinesâ€”from mechanical design and 3D printing to embedded programming and cost analysis. I iterated multiple times to resolve gear alignment, weight imbalance, and integration challenges.
