# OTO – Automated Whiteboard Cleaner

OTO is a low-cost, Arduino-powered whiteboard cleaner designed for classrooms, lecture halls, and meeting spaces. Built as my senior capstone project in Mechatronics Engineering, OTO offers modular expandability, affordability, and easy assembly.

## 🔧 Features
- Cleans standard whiteboards using rack-and-pinion motion
- Expandable to fit 4ft x 8ft boards and beyond
- Cost-effective: prototype costs ~$137 with ~$3.73 per 0.5ft expansion
- Arduino-powered with TMC2209 stepper motor control
- Safety-integrated with limit switches on both ends

## 📂 Project Contents
- `Final_Report.pdf` – Full technical report with documentation and analysis
- `Code/` – Arduino files for button-activated cleaning cycles
- `CAD/` – 3D printable parts, Fusion 360 exports (STL, STEP)
- `Images/` – Prototype, wiring, and exploded view images
- `BOM.xlsx` – Detailed bill of materials and component costs
- `Wiring_Diagram.png` – Electrical schematic (Tinkercad/Fritzing)

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project challenged me across disciplines—from mechanical design and 3D printing to embedded programming and cost analysis. I iterated multiple times to resolve gear alignment, weight imbalance, and integration challenges.
